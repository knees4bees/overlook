# Hotel Overlook
This hotel management app was developed as part of an [assignment](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/overlook.html) at Turing School of Software & Design. Upon logging in, the user sees all of their past and future bookings along with the number of loyalty points they've earned, and they can select a date on which to make a new booking. The booking page shows all available rooms and the user can filter the rooms by type. When the user books a room, a confirmation message and confirmation number are displayed.
